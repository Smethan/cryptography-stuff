my cipher just takes each character, uses the next letter of the alphabet in its place
"I love cryptography!"
"J mpwf dszquphsbqiz!"
"I love cryptography!"
now I could do this in code, but I dont want to make an array of every single letter in the alphabet

as for the big data breach of our era I will be talking about the biggest data breach we know of in recent history which is yahoo's in 2013.
Announced in 2016, yahoo said this breachthat had happened in 2013 had put account information of over 1 billion of its users at risk.
Later they announced the true figure was around 3 billion, and that they would "enhance their security". An investigation found that thankfully no passwords were discovered, but security questions and answers were, which poses essentially the same threat.
We do not know what they have done to protect against it since, as they have kept it a secret, which may well be why they havent had any large breaches lately.
